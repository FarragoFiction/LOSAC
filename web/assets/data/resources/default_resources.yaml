# Resource Types

# Available properties:
#
# name (text, unique, required): The registration key of the resource, used in references and localisation. Must be unique.
# minimum (number): Minimum stockpile count for this resource. Not sure why you'd need this but it's available.
# maximum (number): Maximum stockpile size, beyond which resources are discarded. Maybe handy for some special cases.
